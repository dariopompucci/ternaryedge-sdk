# ternaryedge-sdk
ðŸ§  TernaryEdge SDK â€“ A PyTorch toolkit for training and deploying ultra-efficient ternary neural networks (weights in {-1, 0, +1}) on resource-constrained edge devices. Inc. quantization flows (TWN/TTQ), export to packed ternary formats, early support for NEON/AVX2 inference. Built for keyword spotting, anomaly detection, MLPerf Tiny-class tasks.
